## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps

### App Idea
Lifting App:
This app synchronizes with the apple watch to track your lifting. This would track sets, reps, and count out rest time for you. It would also show gifs of poses for each exercise. It would also let you build custom workouts yourself. It will also let you share your workouts with friends, and show your progress to friends.

- Change the font of the labels, make them prettier!
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well

## Notes

Biggest confusion came from finding the storyboard; I realized that I had to configure the app to create the storyboard rather than in SwiftUI mode upon creation. I had to restart my project because of this.
